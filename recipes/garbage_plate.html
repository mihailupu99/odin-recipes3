            If you are from the Rochester area that phrase would make your mouth
            water. This is any drunk college kids best friend. It is a mixture
            of meat, carbs, and more carbs piled onto a foam container found in
            Nick Tahou's and "hots" food joints all over the Rochester area. For
            about 6 bucks (including tip) you get this plate plus a soda, not
            too shabby. They have a veggie version, fish, and my favorite--the
            white hot version. When I left the Rochester to go to school the
            first thing I would do when I came home was got to a "hots" and
            order a garbage plate. Also dont expect to finish this unless you
            are drunk. For more info on this delicious dish go to wikipedia.org
            and search garbage plate. (I put the direct link on here before but
            it messed up the rest of the recipe for some reason, so youre gonna
            have to do it the hard way lol) Also times are approx. if you make
            your own sauce or not. Also to speed things up I use Recipe #226112
            for the potatoes. This recipe is scaled to one, but it can really
            feed at least four people.... but whats the fun in sharing a garbage
            plate??

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <h3>Preparation Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large skillet, fry chopped onion and garlic in oil until
              soft.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add meat, stirring constantly with a fork to keep its texture
              fine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once meat is cooked, add water and tomato paste. Cook for 10
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then add sugar and spices. Cook for 30 minutes, adding water if
              needed.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Assembly</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mix together the noodles, mayo, celery, seasoning, and carrots.
              Place into a large square foam container (or plate, but not as
              authentic).
            </li>
            <li>
              Fry potatoes in butter until very crispy, then put them next to
              the macaroni salad on the plate.
            </li>
            <li>Place optional beans on the plate if needed.</li>
            <li>Cook hamburger until well done and top with sliced cheese.</li>
            <li>Place burgers on top of the macaroni salad and home fries.</li>
            <li>
              Mix together about equal parts mustard and horseradish and pour on
              top of burgers. Top with optional onions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour hot sauce or very large spoonfuls of special sauce and a huge
              glob of ketchup over burgers. Some like to stir everything
              together so it's one huge mess.
            </li>
            <li>
              Eat with a plastic fork, or just use the bread as a spoon and try
              not to pass out. This should take about an hour to finish.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>YUM, every drunk college kid's dream food.</p>
